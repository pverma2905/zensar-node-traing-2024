1)differnce b/w npm and npx??
npx:-

=>NPX is a package executer, and it is used to execute javascript packages directly, without installing them. 
=>NPX does not install packages, so package pollution on the machine is not a concern.
=>The most common application of NPX is the create-react-app command. Since we only need to use it once, i.e., while initializing the project, we do not install it. 

npm:-

=>NPM is a package manager used to install, delete, and update Javascript packages on your machine.
=>NPM installs packages globally, which means that your machine may be polluted by packages that are not required anymore in the long run. 
=>To use create-react-app using NPM, we would first have to install it globally, and then run it, which makes using NPM in such cases redundant.
