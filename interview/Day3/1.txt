1)readline?
In Node.js, readline is a built-in module that provides an interface for reading data from a Readable stream (like stdin) one line at a time. This is useful for handling user input from the terminal (standard input - stdin) and writing output to the terminal (standard output - stdout).

const readline = require('readline');

// Create an interface for input and output
const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,  // Standard input
  output: process.stdout // Standard output
});

// Ask a question to the user and handle the response
rl.question('What is your name? ', (answer) => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${answer}!`);
  
  // Close the readline interface to end the process
  rl.close();
});


process.stdin: Reads input from the terminal.
process.stdout: Writes output to the terminal.
rl.question(): Prompts the user for input and provides the response to a callback.
